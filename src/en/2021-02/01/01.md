### Read for This Week’s Study
Ps. 100:3; Acts 17:26; Gen. 2:7, 18–25; Gen. 1:28, 29; Gen. 3:15.

> <p>Memory Text</p>
> “Then God said, ‘Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness;. . .’ So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them” (Genesis 1:26, 27, NRSV).

The biblical account of the Creation of humanity is one filled with hope, happiness, and perfection. Each day of Creation ended with the divine pronouncement that it was “good.” Certainly that didn’t include typhoons, earthquakes, famine, and diseases.

What happened?

The sixth day of Creation ended with the divine pronouncement that it was “very good.” That is because that day the Lord created beings in His own image: humans. Something He had not done with anything else in the Genesis account. These beings were, of course, perfect in every way; they’d have to be. After all, they were made in the image of God. Thus, of sheer necessity, they did not include murderers, thieves, liars, swindlers, and the vile in their ranks. What happened?

This week’s lesson looks at the Creation, at what God had first made, and then at what happened to that perfect Creation. Finally, it touches on the quarter’s theme: what God is doing to make things right again.

**The Week at a Glance**: What does the Bible teach about origins? What kind of relationship did God want with humanity? What was the purpose of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? What hope was given to Adam and Eve immediately after they fell?
