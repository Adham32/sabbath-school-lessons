“After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward” (Gen. 15:1).

`Read Genesis 15:1–3. Think of the context in which it was given. Why would the first thing the Lord says to Abram be “Fear not”? What would Abram have to fear?`

What’s particularly interesting here is that the Lord says to Abram that “I am thy shield.” The use of the personal pronoun shows the personal nature of the relationship. God will relate to him one-on-one, the way He will with all of us.

The designation of God as a “Shield” appears here for the first time in the Bible and is the only time God uses it to reveal Himself, even if other Bible writers use the term to speak about God (Deut. 33:29, Ps. 18:30, Ps. 84:11, Ps. 144:2).

`When God calls Himself someone’s shield, what does that mean? Did it mean something to Abram that it might not mean to us now? Can we claim that promise for ourselves? Does it mean no physical harm will come? In what ways is God a shield? How do you understand that image?`

“Christ has not a casual interest in us but an interest stronger than a mother for her child. . . . Our Saviour has purchased us by human suffering and sorrow, by insult, reproach, abuse, mockery, rejection and death. He is watching over you, trembling child of God. He will make you secure under His protection. . . . Our weakness in human nature will not bar our access to the heavenly Father, for He [Christ] died to make intercession for us.”—Ellen G. White, Sons and Daughters of God, p. 77.

`Rolando had been, from all outward appearances, a faithful follower of the Lord. Then, suddenly, he died unexpectedly. What happened to God as his shield? Or must we understand the idea of God as our shield in a different manner? Explain. What does God always promise to shield us from? (See 1 Cor. 10:13.)`
