**Despite Israel’s repeated cycle of apostasy, divine judgments, and repentance, what hope is found in these texts?**

`Isa. 4:3`

`Mic. 4:6, 7`

`Zeph. 3:12, 13`

Although God’s plan for ancient Israel was spoiled by disobedience, it was never completely frustrated. Among the weeds, a few flowers still grew. Many of the Old Testament prophets speak of this faithful remnant, whom God would gather unto Himself as a lovely bouquet.

The purpose of God in creating and preserving a faithful remnant was the same as it had been for all of Israel—to use them as His divinely appointed instruments for declaring “ ‘my glory among the nations’ ” (Isa. 66:19, RSV). By this means, others would join the faithful to “worship the King, the LORD of hosts” (Zech. 14:16, RSV). Thus, no matter how bad the situation became, God always has some faithful people who, despite apostasy within the ranks of God’s chosen people, kept their own calling and election sure (2 Pet. 1:10). In short, whatever the failings of the nation as a whole, there were still those who tried to keep, the best they could, their end of the covenant (see, for instance 1 Kings 19:14–18). And though, perhaps, they suffered with their nation as a whole (such as exile from the land), the final and ultimate covenant promise will be theirs, that of eternal life.

`Read John 10:27, 28. What is Jesus saying there? Apply His words, and the promises in them, to the situation regarding apostasy in ancient Israel. How do these words help explain the existence of a faithful remnant?`

`A few years ago, a young woman gave up her Christian faith entirely, mostly because she was discouraged by the sin, apostasy, and hypocrisy she saw in her local church. “Those people weren’t really Christians,” she said, using that as an excuse to give up everything. Basing your answer on the principles of today’s study, why is her excuse so lame?`
