In those two verses the first stage of God’s covenant promise to Abram (there are three) is revealed. God approached Abram, gave him a command, and then the made him a promise. The approach expresses God’s gracious election of Abram to be the first major figure of His special covenant of grace. The command involves the test of total trust in God (Heb. 11:8). The promise (Gen. 12:1–3, 7), though made specifically to Abram’s descendants, ultimately includes a promise to the whole human race (Gen. 12:3, Gal. 3:6–9).

**The second stage of God’s covenant with Abram appears in Genesis 15:7–18. In what verses do we find some of the same steps that appeared in the first stage?**

`The approach of God to man? Verses?`

`The call to human obedience? Verses?`

`The divine promise? Verses?`

In the solemn ritual of stage two, the Lord appeared to Abram and passed between the carefully arranged pieces of animals. Each of the three animals was slaughtered and divided and the two halves placed one against the other, with a space between. The birds were killed but not divided. Those entering into the covenant were to walk between the divided pieces, symbolically vowing perpetual obedience to the provisions thus solemnly agreed upon.

`Describe what took place during the third and final stage of divine covenant making with Abraham. (See Gen. 17:1–14.)`

The meaning of the name Abraham underscores God’s desire and design to save all peoples. The “many nations” would include both Jews and Gentiles. The New Testament makes it abundantly clear that the true descendants of Abraham are those who have the faith of Abraham and who trust in the merits of the promised Messiah. (See Gal. 3:7, 29.) Thus, as far back as Abraham, the Lord’s intention was to save as many human beings as He could, whatever nations they lived in. No doubt, it’s no different today.

`Read Revelation 14:6, 7, the first angel’s message. What parallels can you find between what the angel is saying and what happened in the Abrahamic covenant? In what ways are the issues the same?`
