Paul is practical in his inspired words to the Ephesians. The unity that exists between Jews and Gentiles, between people of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, is not a myth or simply a theoretical construct; it is a reality that demands us “to walk worthy of the calling with which you were called” (Eph. 4:1, NKJV).

`According to Ephesians 4:1-3, in what way are Christians to walk worthy of their calling in Christ?`

The practical outcome of these virtues and graces in the Christian’s life helps “keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace” (Eph. 4:3, NKJV). All these attributes are rooted in love (1  Cor. 13:1-7). The active practice of love preserves relationships among brothers and sisters and promotes peace and unity in the Christian community and beyond. Unity in the church manifests God’s love in unique ways that others can witness. The church is called to be such a witness, especially in a time of strife, divisions, and wars.

`Read Ephesians 4:4-6. What is one crucial theme in these three verses?`

In the first verses of this chapter, Paul expresses his deep interest in the unity of the church. He begins with an exhortation to unity (Eph. 4:1-3) and follows with a list of the seven elements that unite believers (Eph. 4:4-6). Unity is simultaneously something that believers already possess (Eph. 4:4-6), something that must be constantly worked on and maintained (Eph. 4:1-3), and something that is the future goal toward which we strive (Eph. 4:13).

“The apostle exhorts his brethren to manifest in their lives the power of the truth which he had presented to them. By meekness and gentleness, forbearance and love, they were to exemplify the character of Christ and the blessings of His salvation. There is but one body, and one Spirit, one Lord, one faith. As members of the body of Christ all believers are animated by the same spirit and the same hope. Divisions in the church dishonor the religion of Christ before the world and give occasion to the enemies of truth to justify their course. Paul’s instructions were not written alone for the church in his day. God designed that they should be sent down to us. What are we doing to preserve unity in the bonds of peace?”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 239.

`What choices can you make right now in order to be sure that you are walking “worthy of the calling with which you were called”?`
