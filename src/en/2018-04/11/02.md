In discussions about worship, we often highlight elements of worship, what it includes and how it is done. But what is the deep meaning of worship? What does it mean to worship God? And why do we do it? In Psalm 29:2, David states: “Give unto the Lord the glory due to His name; worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness” (Ps. 29:2, NKJV). This psalm points us in the right direction to understand the meaning of worship. To worship the Lord is to give Him the glory and honor He deserves.

`Read Revelation 4 and 5. What reasons do the inhabitants of heaven give for worshiping God and Jesus, the Lamb of God? See Rev. 4:8, 11; 5:9, 10, 12, 13.`

This depiction of worship in the throne room of heaven as Jesus is introduced as the Lamb of God and Savior of the world is awe- inspiring. Worship happens when God’s creation responds to Him with words of adoration and thankfulness for what He has done. Worship is the response of a grateful person for God’s creation and salvation. At the end of time, the redeemed also will join in adoration and respond in a similar way to God’s salvation. “ ‘Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty! Just and true are Your ways, O King of the saints! Who shall not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy. For all nations shall come and worship before You, for Your judgments have been manifested’ ” (Rev. 15:3, 4, NKJV).

So, worship is a response of our faith in God for His mighty works: first, for creating us, and, second, for redeeming us. In worship we give to God the adoration, reverence, praise, love, and obedience we believe He is worthy to receive. Of course, what we know about God, as our Creator and Savior, comes from what He revealed to us in Scripture. Furthermore, what Christians know about God was revealed more fully in the person and ministry of Jesus (see John 14:8-14). That is why Christians worship Jesus as Savior and Redeemer, as His sacrificial death and resurrection are at the very core of worship.

When Christians come together in worship, it is out of this sense of awe and thankfulness that our worship should proceed.

`Think about what we have been given in Christ as our Creator and Savior, about what He has spared us from, and about what He offers us—all because He willingly died in our stead. Why should these truths be the foundation of all our worship?`
