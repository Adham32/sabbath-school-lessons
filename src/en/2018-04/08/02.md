Although as Seventh-day Adventists we have much in common with other Christian bodies, our set of beliefs form a unique system of biblical truth that no one else in the Christian world is proclaiming. These truths help define us as God’s end-time remnant.

`Read Acts 4:8-12, 10:43. What importance does Peter give to the place of Jesus Christ in his understanding of the plan of salvation?`

The apostle Paul told the Corinthians that the good news is “that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself ” (2 Cor. 5:19, NKJV). Christ’s death is the means of our reconciliation with the Father, bridging the chasm left by sin and death. For centuries, Christians have pondered the meaning of Jesus’ death, resurrection, and the reconciliation He came to accomplish. This process of reconciliation has been termed atonement, an old English word that originally meant “at-onement.” This is a state of being “at one,” or in agreement. Accordingly, atonement denotes harmony in a relationship, and when there has been estrangement, this harmony would be the result of reconciliation. Church unity is thus a gift of this reconciliation.

**What do the following passages teach about the meaning of Jesus’ death and resurrection?**

`Rom. 3:24, 25`

`1 John 2:2`

`1 John 4:9, 10`

`1 Pet. 2:21-24`

Though we hold this belief in Christ’s death and resurrection in common with many other Christian bodies, we proclaim it in the context of the “everlasting gospel” (Rev. 14:6), part of the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14:6-12. As Seventh-day Adventists, we place an emphasis on these messages that no other Christian body does.

`How can you learn to keep before you at all times the reality of Christ’s death and resurrection and the hope that it offers?`
