`Read Acts 15:1, 2 and Galatians 2:11-14. What are the two issues that caused serious conflict in the early church?`

The threat to church unity faced by early Christians was real and difficult. Some Jewish Christians thought that salvation was possible only for those who belonged to the covenant people of God, and this implied that circumcision was a requirement. And as part of a faithful lifestyle, these Jewish believers also believed that they were to avoid any contacts with Gentiles that could possibly thwart their own salvation.

The Jews had very strict traditions in regard to their association with Gentiles. These traditions quickly became a stumbling block for the new Christian community when the apostles began to reach out to Gentiles who wished to become followers of Jesus. Because the Messiah is the Savior of God’s covenant people, as predicted in the Old Testament, weren’t Gentiles supposed to become Jews first and then follow the same covenant rules if they wanted to be saved?

`Read Acts 15:3-22. What were some issues presented during the Jerusalem Council?`

The issue here was rooted in conflicts over deeply held interpretations of the Old Testament stories regarding circumcision and relationship with Gentiles. As apostles, elders, and delegates from Antioch sat together, it seems the discussion went on for a long time without any resolution.

But then Peter, Barnabas, and Paul made speeches. Peter’s speech alluded to the visionary revelation that God gave him and to the gift of the Holy Spirit, which opened the way for the mission to the Gentiles. Then Paul and Barnabas shared their stories of what God had done through them for the Gentiles. As a result, many eyes were opened to new truth. Said Peter: “ ‘We believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved in the same manner as they,’ ” meaning the Gentiles (Acts 15:11, NKJV). Centuries of long-held tradition were unraveling in light of the gospel.

`Was there ever a time you changed your mind about how you understood a deeply held belief? What did you learn from the experience that could perhaps help you when you might again have to question your understanding of a belief?`
