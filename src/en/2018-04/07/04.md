Reports of what happened in Caesarea with Cornelius soon reached the leaders of the Christian community in Jerusalem, and they asked Peter to give an account of what happened. They were offended by what Peter had done because, according to their Jewish understanding of the Law of Moses, faithful Jews were not allowed to eat with Gentiles (Acts 11:3).

`Read Acts 11:4-18. What did Peter say to explain the work of the Holy Spirit and His leading in this event? What was the main point he was making by recounting what had happened?`

Although some raised questions about the legitimacy of Peter’s actions and his decision to baptize these Gentiles, sufficient witnesses (Acts 11:12) certified that the Holy Spirit did indeed manifest His presence in the same way as at Pentecost. The guidance and leading of the Holy Spirit in this case is unassailable and the gift acknowledged. “When they heard these things they became silent; and they glorified God, saying, ‘Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life’ ” (Acts 11:18, NKJV).

`Read Acts 11:19-24. What happened next in the life of the early church?`

Perhaps some in Jerusalem thought that what happened with Cornelius and his household would be an exception and that such an experience would not be repeated. But that’s not what the Holy Spirit intended. As the disciples of Jesus scattered beyond Jerusalem and Judea, because of the persecution that arose after Stephen’s death (Acts 8:1), and went to Samaria, Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, subsequently more and more Gentiles accepted Jesus as their Savior. This is what Jesus had predicted (Acts 1:8). As wonderful as this influx of Gentiles was, if we put ourselves in the place of these early Jewish believers it’s not hard to see how they weren’t quite sure how to react.

`How might we ourselves be holding on to narrow views of the church and of our message that could hamper our witness?`
