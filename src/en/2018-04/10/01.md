### Read for This Week’s Study
2 Tim. 4:11, Philem. 1-25, 2 Cor. 10:12-15, Rom. 5:8-11, Eph. 4:26, Matt. 18:15-17.

> “For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life” (Romans 5:10, NKJV).

As we have seen, even after Pentecost the relationship between believers was at times strained. The New Testament records repeated examples of the way that church leaders and individual members dealt with such challenges. These principles are extremely valuable for the church today. They reveal the positive results that can come when we use biblical principles to deal with conflicts and preserve our oneness in Christ.

In this week’s lesson, we will focus on restored relationships and how our human relationships impact our oneness in Christ. The ministry of the Holy Spirit involves bringing people closer to God and to one another. It includes breaking down the barriers in our relationship with God and breaking down barriers in our relationships with one another. In short, the greatest demonstration of the power of the gospel is not necessarily what the church says but how the church lives.

“ ‘By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another’ ” (John 13:35, NKJV). Without this love all our talk about church unity will come to nothing.
