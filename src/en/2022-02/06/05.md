`Read Genesis 14:1–17. What is significant about this war taking place just after the gift of the Promised Land? What does this story teach us about Abram?`

This is the first war narrated in the Scriptures (Gen. 14:2). The coalition of four armies from Mesopotamia and Persia against the other coalition of five Canaanite armies, including the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 14:8), suggest a large conflict (Gen. 14:9). The reason for this military operation has to do with the fact that the Canaanite peoples had rebelled against their Babylonian suzerains (Gen. 14:4, 5). Although this story refers to a specific historical conflict, the timing of this “global” war, just after God’s gift of the Promised Land to Abram, gives this event a particular spiritual significance.

The involvement of so many peoples from the country of Canaan suggests that the issue at stake in this conflict was sovereignty over the land. Ironically, the camp of Abram, the truly interested party, because he is the only true owner of the land, is the only force that remains outside of the conflict, at least at first.

The reason for Abram’s neutrality is that for Abram, the Promised Land was not acquired through the force of arms or through the wisdom of political strategies. Abram’s kingdom was God’s gift. The only reason Abram will intervene is the fate of his nephew Lot, who was taken prisoner in the course of the battles (Gen. 14:12, 13).

“Abraham, dwelling in peace in the oak groves at Mamre, learned from one of the fugitives the story of the battle and the calamity that had befallen his nephew. He had cherished no unkind memory of Lot’s ingratitude. All his affection for him was awakened, and he determined that he should be rescued. Seeking, first of all, divine counsel, Abraham prepared for war.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 135.

But Abram does not confront the whole coalition. In what must have been a quick and nocturne commando operation, he attacks only the camp where Lot was held prisoner. Lot is saved. Thus, this faithful man of God also showed great courage and fortitude. No doubt his influence in the region grew, and people saw the kind of man he was and learned something more of the God whom he served.

`What kind of influence do our actions have on others? What kind of message are we sending about our faith by our actions?`
