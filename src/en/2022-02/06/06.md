`Read Genesis 14:18–24 and Hebrews 7:1–10. Who was Melchizedek? Why did Abram give his tithe to this priest who seems to appear out of nowhere?`

The sudden appearance of the mysterious Melchizedek is not out of place. After Abram has been thanked by the Canaanite kings, he now thanks this priest, a thankfulness revealed by his paying his tithe to him.

Melchizedek comes from the city of Salem, which means “peace,” an appropriate message after the turmoil of war.

The component tsedek, “justice,” in the name of Melchizedek, appears in contrast to the name of the king of Sodom, Bera (“in evil”), and Gomorrah, Birsha (“in wickedness”), probably surnames for what they represent (Gen. 14:2).

Melchizedek appears after the reversal of the violence and evil represented by the other Canaanite kings. This passage also contains the first biblical reference to the word “priest” (Gen. 14:18). The association of Melchizedek with “God Most High” (Gen. 14:18, NKJV), whom Abram calls his own God (Gen. 14:22), clearly indicates that Abram saw him as priest of the God Abram served. Melchizedek is, however, not to be identified with Christ. He was God’s representative among the people of that time (see Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, pp. 1092, 1093).

Melchizedek officiates, indeed, as a priest. He serves “bread and wine,” an association that often implies the use of fresh-pressed grape juice (Deut. 7:13, 2 Chron. 31:5), which reappears in the context of the giving of the tithes (Deut. 14:23). In addition, he extends blessing to Abram (Gen. 14:19).

Abram, meanwhile, “gave him a tithe of all” (Gen. 14:20, NKJV) as a response to God the Creator, the “Possessor of heaven and earth” (Gen. 14:19, NKJV). This title alludes to the introduction of the Creation story (Gen. 1:1, NKJV), where the phrase “heavens and earth” means totality or “all.” As such, the tithe is understood as an expression of gratitude to the Creator, who owns everything (Heb. 7:2–6; compare with Gen. 28:22). Paradoxically, the tithe is understood by the worshiper not as a gift _to_ God, but as a gift _from_ God, because God gives us everything to begin with.

`Why is the act of returning tithe a powerful indicator of faith, as well as a great faith-building act?`
