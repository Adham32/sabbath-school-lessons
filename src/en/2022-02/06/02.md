`Read Genesis 12:1–9. Why did God call Abram to leave his country and family? How did Abram respond?`

The last time that God had spoken with a person, at least as recorded in Scripture, it was with Noah, to reassure him after the Flood that He would establish a covenant with all flesh (Gen. 9:15–17) and that another worldwide flood would never come. God’s new word, now to Abram, reconnects with that promise: all the nations of the earth will be blessed through Abram.

The fulfillment of that prophecy begins with leaving the past. Abram leaves all that is familiar to him, his family, his country, even a part of himself. The intensity of this going is reflected in the repetition of the keyword “go,” which occurs seven times in this context. Abram has first to leave his country, “Ur of the Chaldeans,” which also is Babylonia (Gen. 11:31, NKJV; Isa. 13:19). The call to “go out of Babylon” has a long history among the biblical prophets (Isa. 48:20, Rev. 18:4).

Abram’s departure also concerns his family. Abram must leave his heritage and much of what he learned and acquired through heredity, education, and influence.

Yet, God’s call to go involves even more. The Hebrew phrase _lekh lekha_, “go,” translated literally, means “go yourself” or “go for yourself.” Abram’s departure from Babylon concerns more than his environment, or even his family. The Hebrew phrase suggests an emphasis on _himself_. Abram has to leave _himself_, to get rid of the part of himself that contains his Babylonian past.

The goal of this abandonment is “a land” that God will show him. The same language will be used again in the context of the sacrifice of Isaac (Gen. 22:2) to refer to the mount of Moriah, where Isaac will be offered and where the Jerusalem temple will be built (2 Chron. 3:1). God’s promise is not just about a physical homeland but about the salvation of the world. This idea is reaffirmed in God’s promise of the blessing for all nations (Gen. 12:2, 3). The verb _barakh_, “bless,” appears five times in this passage. This universal blessing for all people will come through the “seed” of Abram (Gen. 22:18, Gen. 26:4, Gen. 28:14). The text refers here to the “seed” that will ultimately be fulfilled in Jesus Christ (Acts 3:25).

`What might God be calling you to leave behind? That is, what part of your life might you have to abandon in order to heed the call of God?`
