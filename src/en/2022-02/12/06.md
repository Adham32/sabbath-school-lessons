`Read Genesis 45. What lessons of love, faith, and hope can be found in this story?`

It was at that very moment, when Judah talked about the “ ‘evil’ ” that would fall upon ’avi, “ ‘my father’ ” (Gen. 44:34), that Joseph “cried out” (Gen. 45:1, NKJV) and then “made himself known” to his brothers. This expression, often used to refer to God’s self-revelation (Exod. 6:3, Ezek. 20:9), suggests that it is God who had revealed Himself here, as well. That is, the Lord had shown that His providence reigns, even despite human foibles.

Joseph’s brothers cannot believe what they are hearing and seeing. Thus, Joseph is obliged to repeat, “ ‘I am Joseph your brother’ ” (Gen. 45:4, NKJV), and it is only the second time, when they hear the precise words “ ‘whom you sold into Egypt’ ” (Gen. 45:4, NKJV), that they believe.

Joseph then declares: “ ‘God sent me’ ” (Gen. 45:5, NKJV). This reference to God has a double purpose. It serves not only to reassure his brothers that Joseph does not have hard feelings toward them; but it also is a profound confession of faith, and an expression of hope, because what they did was necessary for the “ ‘great deliverance’ ” and the survival of a “ ‘posterity’ ” (Gen. 45:7, NKJV).

Joseph then urges his brothers to go to his father in order to prepare him to come to Egypt. He accompanies his call with specific words concerning the place where they will “ ‘dwell,’ ” that is, Goshen, famous for its rich pasture, “ ‘the best of the land’ ” (Gen. 45:10, 18, NKJV). He also takes care of the transportation: carts are provided, which will ultimately convince Jacob that his sons were not lying to him about what they had just experienced (Gen. 45:27). Jacob takes this visible demonstration as evidence that Joseph is alive, and this is enough for him to come alive again (compare with Gen. 37:35, Gen. 44:29).

Things are now good. Jacob’s 12 sons are alive. Jacob is now called “Israel” (Gen. 45:28), and the providence of God has been made manifest in a powerful way.

`Yes, Joseph was gracious to his brothers. He could afford to be. How, though, do we learn to be gracious to those whose evil toward us doesn’t turn out as well for us as what Joseph experienced?`
