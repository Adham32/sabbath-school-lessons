`Read Genesis 2:2, 3 and Exodus 20:8–11. Why is the seventh-day Sabbath related to Creation? How does this connection impact how we keep the Sabbath?`

It is precisely because “God ended” His works of Creation that He instituted the Sabbath. The seventh-day Sabbath is, therefore, the expression of our faith that God finished His work then, and that He found it “very good.” To keep the Sabbath is to join with God in the recognition of the value and beauty of His creation.

We can rest from our works just as God had rested from His. Sabbath keeping means saying yes to God’s “very good” Creation, which includes our physical bodies. Contrary to some ancient (and modern) beliefs, nothing in Scripture, Old or New Testament, denigrates the body as evil. That’s a pagan concept, not a biblical one. Instead, Sabbath keepers are grateful for God’s creation—which includes their own flesh—and that is why they can enjoy the creation and why they take care of it.

The Sabbath, which marks the first “end” of human history, also is a sign of hope for suffering humankind and for the groaning of the world. It is interesting that the phrase “finished the work” reappears at the end of the construction of the sanctuary (Exod. 40:33) and again at the end of the building of Solomon’s temple (1 Kings 7:40, 51)—both places where the lesson of the gospel and salvation had been taught.

After the Fall, the Sabbath, at the end of the week, points to the miracle of salvation, which will take place only through the miracle of a new creation (Isa. 65:17, Rev. 21:1). The Sabbath is a sign at the end of our human week that the suffering and trials of this world will have an end, as well.

This is why Jesus chose the Sabbath as the most appropriate day to heal the sick (Luke 13:13–16). Contrary to whatever traditions the leaders were stuck in, by the Sabbath healings Jesus pointed the people, and us, to the time when all pain, all suffering, all death, will be over, which is the ultimate conclusion to the salvation process. Hence, each Sabbath points us to the hope of redemption.

`By resting on the Sabbath day, how are we experiencing the rest and salvation that we have in Jesus now and that which will be fulfilled, ultimately, in the creation of the new heaven and new earth?`
