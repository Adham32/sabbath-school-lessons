Now that Jacob has reconciled with his brother, he wants to settle in the land of Canaan in peace. The word shalem, “safely” (Gen. 33:18, NKJV), from the word shalom, “peace,” for the first time characterizes his journey.

After having purchased a piece of land from the inhabitants (Gen. 33:19), he erects an altar there, showing his faith and his realization of how dependent upon the Lord he really is. For every one of the sacrifices offered, there was an act of worship.

Yet, for the first time in his life, Jacob-Israel is exposed to the troubles of settling in the land. Like Isaac at Gerar with Abimelech (Gen. 26:1–33), Jacob tries to find accommodation with the Canaanites.

`Read Genesis 34. What happened to upset his plans for a peaceful existence?`

The story of this sordid incident highlights the ambiguity of the characters and of their actions. The sensual Shechem, who violates Dinah, also is characterized as sincere and loving Dinah, and he wants to try to make amends. He is even willing to undergo the covenant rite of circumcision.

Meanwhile, Simeon and Levi, who present themselves as the defenders of God and His commandments, and who resist intermarriage with the Canaanites (Lev. 19:29), resort to lies and deception (Gen. 34:13) and are ready to kill and plunder (Gen. 34:25–27). Their actions were not only reprehensible (why not punish the one man who had done it?) but also had the potential to cause many more problems.

As for Jacob, he only is concerned with peace. When the rape of his daughter is reported to him, he does not say anything (Gen. 34:5). However, after he hears about what his sons have done, he openly chides them because of what could follow: “ ‘You have troubled me by making me obnoxious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and since I am few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and kill me. I shall be destroyed, my household and I’ ” (Gen. 34:30, NKJV).

`Again and again we see deceit and deception, as well as acts of kindness and grace, in these accounts. What does this tell us about human nature?`
