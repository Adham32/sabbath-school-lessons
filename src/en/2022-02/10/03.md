From Peniel, “the face of God” (see Gen. 32:30), the place where he had this experience with God, Jacob moves now to meet with his brother. After 20 years of separation, Jacob sees him coming with 400 men (Gen. 33:1). Jacob is worried and, therefore, prepares himself and his family for whatever might happen.

`Read Genesis 33. What connection is there between Jacob’s experience of seeing the face of God at Peniel and Jacob’s experience of seeing the face of his brother? What is the implication of this connection in regard to our relationship with God and our relationship with our “brothers,” whoever they may be?`

Jacob bows himself seven times before his brother (Gen. 33:3), whom he calls several times “ ‘my lord’ ” (Gen. 33:8, 13, 15, NKJV) and with whom he identifies himself as his “ ‘servant’ ” (Gen. 33:5; compare with Gen. 32:4, 18, 20, NKJV). Significantly, Jacob’s seven bows echo his father’s seven blessings (Gen. 27:27–29); furthermore, when he bows, he specifically reverses his father’s blessing, about “ ‘nations [bowing] down to you’ ” (Gen. 27:29, NKJV).

It is as if Jacob’s intention was to pay his debt to his brother and return the blessing that he had stolen from him (see Gen. 33:11). When Esau saw his brother, against all expectations, he ran to Jacob and, instead of killing him, he “kissed him, and they wept” (Gen. 33:4, NKJV).

Later, Jacob commented to Esau: “ ‘I have seen your face as though I had seen the face of God’ ” (Gen. 33:10, NKJV). The reason for Jacob’s extraordinary statement was his understanding that Esau had forgiven him. The Hebrew verb ratsah, “pleased” (Gen. 33:10, NKJV), is a theological term referring to any sacrifice that is “pleasing,” “accepted” by God, which then implies divine forgiveness (Lev. 22:27, Amos 5:22).

Jacob’s experience of God’s forgiveness at Peniel, where he saw the face of God, is now repeated in his experience of his brother’s forgiveness, which he identifies as if he saw the face of God. Jacob lives a second Peniel, the first one preparing for the second one. Jacob has been forgiven by God and by his own brother. Truly, he now must have understood, even more than before, the meaning of grace.

`What have you learned about grace from how others (besides the Lord) have forgiven you?`
