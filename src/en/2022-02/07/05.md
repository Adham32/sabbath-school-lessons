The last scene of circumcision involved everyone: not only Ishmael—but also all the males of Abraham’s household were circumcised (Gen. 17:23–27). The word kol, “all,” “every,” is repeated four times (Gen. 17:23, 27). It is against this inclusive background that God appears to Abraham to confirm the promise of a son, “Isaac.”

`Read Genesis 18:1–15 and Romans 9:9. What lessons of hospitality do we learn from Abraham’s reception of his visitors? How do you explain God’s response to Abraham’s hospitality?`

It is not clear whether Abraham knew who these strangers were (Heb. 13:2), even though he acted toward them as if God Himself were among them. He was sitting “in the tent door in the heat of the day” (Gen. 18:1, NKJV), and because visitors are rare in the desert, he was probably longing to meet with them. Abraham ran toward the men (Gen. 18:2), although he was 99 years old. He called one of these persons Adonai, “my Lord” (Gen. 18:3), a title often used for God (Gen. 20:4, Exod. 15:17). He rushed around them in the preparation of the meal (Gen. 18:6, 7). He stood next to them, attentive to their needs and ready to serve them (Gen. 18:8).

Abraham’s behavior toward heavenly strangers will become an inspiring model of hospitality (Heb. 13:2). In fact, Abraham’s attitude of reverence conveys a philosophy of hospitality. Showing respect and care toward strangers is not just a nice gesture of courtesy. The Bible emphasizes that it is a religious duty, as if directed toward God Himself (compare with Matt. 25:35–40). Ironically, God is identified more with the hungry and needy foreigner than with the generous one who receives them.

On the other hand, the divine intrusion into the human sphere denotes His grace and love toward humanity. This appearance of God anticipates Christ, who left His heavenly home and became a human servant to reach humankind (Phil. 2:7, 8). God’s appearance here provides evidence for the certainty of His promise (Gen. 18:10, NKJV). He sees Sarah, who hides herself “behind him” (Gen. 18:10), and knows her most intimate thoughts (Gen. 18:12). He knows that she laughed, and the word “laugh” is His last word. Her skepticism becomes the place where He will fulfill His word.

`Dwell more on the idea that “God is identified more with the hungry and needy foreigner than with the generous one who receives them.” Why is this concept so important for us to remember?`
