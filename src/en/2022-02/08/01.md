### Read for This Week’s Study
Genesis 22, Heb. 11:17, Lev. 18:21, John 1:1–3, Rom. 5:6–8, Genesis 23–25, Rom. 4:1–12.

> <p>Memory Text:</p>
> “Now Abraham was old, well advanced in age; and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things” (Genesis 24:1, NKJV).

Finally, as God had promised, Sarah bore Abraham a son, “in his old age” (Gen. 21:2), and he named the baby Isaac (see Gen. 21:1–5). But the story of Abraham is far from over, reaching a climactic moment when he took his son to Mount Moriah to be sacrificed. Isaac, however, is replaced by a ram (Gen. 22:13), which signified God’s commitment to bless the nations through his “seed” (Gen. 22:17, 18). That Seed, of course, was Jesus (Acts 13:23). Hence, in this astonishing (and in some ways troubling) story, more of the plan of salvation is revealed.

Whatever the deep spiritual lessons here, the family of Abraham, nevertheless, must have been shaken by it, and the future of Abraham is not clear. Sarah dies after the sacrifice at Moriah (Genesis 23), and Isaac remains single.

Abraham then takes the initiative to make sure that the “right” future will follow him. He arranges the marriage of his son to Rebekah (Genesis 24), who will give birth to two sons (Gen. 25:21–23), and Abraham himself marries Keturah, who will give him many children (Gen. 25:1–6). This week, we will follow Abraham to the end of his life (Gen. 25:7–11).
