Deuteronomy makes it so clear that the law and the covenant were central, not only to Israel’s relationship to God, but also to the nation’s purpose as the “chosen” people (Deut. 7:6, Deut. 14:2, Deut. 18:5).

`Read Deuteronomy 10:12–15, where much of this idea of law and Israel’s chosen status is stressed. What, however, does the Bible mean by the phrase “heaven of heavens”? What point is Moses making with that phrase?`

What “heaven of heavens” means isn’t absolutely clear, at least in this immediate context, but Moses is pointing to the majesty, power, and grandeur of God. That is, not only heaven itself but also “the heaven of the heavens” belongs to Him, most likely an idiomatic expression that points to God’s complete sovereignty over all the creation.

**Read the following verses, all based on the phrase that appears first in Deuteronomy. In each case, what point is being made, and how do we see the influence of Deuteronomy there?**

`1 Kings 8:27`

`Neh. 9:6`

`Ps. 148:4`

Especially clear in Nehemiah 9 is the theme of God as the Creator and the One who alone should be worshiped. He made everything, even “the heaven of heavens, with all their host” (Neh. 9:6, NKJV). In fact, Nehemiah 9:3 says that he “read from the Book of the Law” (NKJV), most likely, as in the time of Josiah, the book of Deuteronomy, which explains why a few verses later the Levites, amid their praise and worship of God, used the phrase “heaven of heavens,” which came directly from Deuteronomy.

`God is the Creator not only of earth but also of “the heaven of heavens.” And then to think that this same God went to the cross! Why is worship such an appropriate response to what God has done for us?`
