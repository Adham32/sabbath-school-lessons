All through the Bible, we are presented with one of two choices. Two options are presented here for us.

**Read the following texts. What two options, what two choices, are either openly stated or implied in these texts, and how are these options presented?**

`John 3:16`

`Gen. 7:22, 23`

`Rom. 6:23`

`Rom. 8:6`

`1 John 5:12`

`Matt. 7:24–27`

In the end, there is no middle ground for us human beings. Before the great controversy is completely over, sin, Satan, evil, disobedience, and rebellion will be eradicated. After that happens, each one of us, individually, will either have the life, the eternal life, that God origi­nally had planned for us all to have before the Creation of the world, or face eternal death, that is, ”everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power” (2 Thess. 1:9, NKJV). The Bible doesn’t appear to present any other options for us.

Which fate will be ours? That answer, ultimately, rests with us. We have the choice before us, life or death.

`In the context of eternal life or eternal death, why is the biblical truth that hell is not burning and torturing people forever such a comforting truth? What would it say about the character of God were eternal, conscious torment truly the fate of the lost?`
