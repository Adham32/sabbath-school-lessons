The Hebrew nation on the borders of Canaan, God’s chosen people, are finally about to inherit the land that God had promised them. And, as we have seen, Deuteronomy is Moses’ final instructions to the Hebrews before they take the land. And among those instructions were the commands to obey.

`Read the following texts. What point is expressed again and again and again, and why is this point so important for the people? Deut. 4:44, Deut. 17:19, Deut. 28:58, Deut. 30:10, Deut. 31:12, Deut. 32:46, Deut. 33:2.`

Even the most cursory reading of the book of Deuteronomy shows how crucial obedience to the law was for the nation of Israel. In a real sense, it was the people’s covenant obligation. God had done so much for them and would continue to do so much for them—things that they couldn’t do for themselves and that they did not deserve to begin with (which is what grace is: God giving us what we don’t deserve). And what He asked in response was, well, obedience to His law.

It’s no different now. God’s grace saves us, apart from the works of the law—“therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law” (Rom. 3:28, NKJV)—and our response is obedience to the law. We obey the law, though, not in a vain attempt to be saved by it—“therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin” (Rom. 3:20, NKJV)—but as the result of the salvation that we so graciously have been given. “If you love Me, keep My commandments” (John 14:15, NKJV).

Deuteronomy could be seen as one big object lesson in grace and law. By grace God redeems us, doing for us what we couldn’t do for ourselves (any more than Israel could have escaped from Egypt by themselves), and in response we live, by faith, a life of obedience to Him and to His law. From the fall of Adam onward, up to those who live through the time of trouble and the mark of the beast, a people depicted as those who “keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus” (Rev. 14:12, NKJV)—God’s relationship with His covenant people is one of law and grace. God’s grace forgives us for having violated His law, and God’s grace enables us to obey His law, as well, an obedience that arises from our covenant relationship with Him.

`How can we avoid the trap of legalism as we obey the law?`
