`Read Revelation 5:8–14 along with Ephesians 1:20–23 and Hebrews 10:12. Together, what are they saying that should give us great hope and comfort amid a world that, in and of itself, offers so little of either?`

As Christ the Lamb approaches the throne, He takes the scroll. This act shows that all authority and sovereignty belong to Him (see Matt. 28:18, Eph. 1:20–22). At that moment, the whole universe acknowledges Christ’s rightful rule over earth. What was lost with Adam has been regained with Christ.

When Christ takes the scroll, it shows He holds the destiny of all humanity in His hands. The four living creatures and the 24 elders fall down before Him and worship, as they did in Revelation 5:9: “ ‘You are worthy to take the scroll, and to open its seals; for You were slain’ ” (NKJV). By this act of adoration, the exalted angels and the representatives of redeemed humanity affirm Christ’s sacrifice on behalf of humanity. With His blood, He has paid the ransom for fallen human beings and offers them all the hope of redemption and the promise of a future we barely can imagine.

The four living creatures and the elders are now joined by the countless number of the angelic host surrounding the throne and directing praises to the Lamb that had been slain and now “lives to make intercession” for the fallen race (Heb. 7:25, NKJV). In unison, the occupants of the throne room exclaim with a loud voice: “ ‘Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing!’ ” (Rev. 5:12, NKJV).

At this point all creation in heaven and on earth joins together in offering royal adoration both to the Father and Christ: “ ‘Blessing and honor and glory and power be to Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever!’ ” (Rev. 5:13, NKJV). Their praise is met with an “ ‘Amen’ ” by the four living creatures and the prostration of the 24 elders, thus concluding this rapturous veneration in the heavenly throne room.

`Physicists speculate that one day the universe will burn out, collapse in on itself, or just rip apart. What a contrast to the future presented in the Word of God! How can we start rejoicing, even now, in the future that awaits us?`
