`Read Revelation 12:7–9, which talks about a war in heaven. What was the nature of that war that resulted in Satan’s expulsion from heaven?`

Satan was cast out of heaven at the beginning of the great controversy, when he rebelled against God’s government. He wanted to seize God’s throne in heaven and be “like the most High” (Isa. 14:12–15). He stood in open revolt against God but was defeated and exiled on earth. However, by deceiving Adam and Eve, Satan usurped Adam’s rule over this world (Luke 4:6). As the self-proclaimed ruler of this world (John 12:31), Satan claimed the right to attend the heavenly council as earth’s representative (Job 1:6–12). However, since his defeat at the cross, Satan and his fallen angels have been confined to the earth as a prison until they receive their punishment (2 Pet. 2:4, Jude 6).

By His death, Jesus redeemed what was lost, and Satan’s true character was revealed before the universe. “Satan saw that his disguise was torn away. His administration was laid open before the unfallen angels and before the heavenly universe. He had revealed himself as a murderer. By shedding the blood of the Son of God, he had uprooted himself from the sympathies of the heavenly beings. Henceforth his work was restricted.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 761. Before the whole universe, the rule over the earth was transferred from Satan to Jesus, and He was proclaimed the legitimate ruler over the earth (Eph. 1:20–22, Phil. 2:9–11).

Jesus foretold this event, saying: “ ‘Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out’ ” (John 12:31, NASB).

With this judgment on Satan, the “ ‘salvation and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ have come’ ” (Rev. 12:10, NKJV). Satan still has limited power to harm God’s people on earth, but it is with a realization that “he has a short time” left (Rev. 12:12, NKJV). Although his time is indeed “short,” he is doing all that he can to cause pain, suffering, and havoc here.

`What does Revelation 12:11 teach about how to defend against the devil? (See also Eph. 6:10–18.)`
