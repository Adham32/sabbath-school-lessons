> “But in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, the mystery of God would be finished, as He declared to His servants the prophets” (Revelation 10:7, NKJV).

In the scene of the fifth seal, we saw that the cry of God’s oppressed people reflects the cry of the faithful of all ages. These faithful ones were portrayed as souls under the altar, crying to God for justice and vindication, saying: “ ‘How long, O Lord?’ ” (Rev. 6:10, NKJV). The voice from heaven urged them to wait, because the day was coming when God would judge those who harmed them. Revelation 6:15–17 pictures Jesus returning to this earth and bringing judgment upon those who did evil to His faithful followers.

The scene of the fifth seal represents the experience of God’s suffering people throughout history, from the time of Abel until the time when God will finally judge and avenge “ ‘the blood of His servants’ ” (Rev. 19:2, NKJV). God’s suffering people must remain firm and believe that God hears the prayers of His people.

The vision of the seven trumpets shows that, throughout history, God already has intervened on behalf of His oppressed people and has judged those who harmed them. The purpose of the seven trumpets is to assure God’s people that heaven is not indifferent to their suffering.
