We are currently searching for a copy of the Sabbath School Study Guides in Portuguese.

If you (or someone you know) works for an Adventist Conference, Union, Division or Publishing House that produces the Study Guides in Portuguese, please contact Pastor Jared Martin at jaredmartin@adventist.org.au so we can add them into the app.  

It is our goal to make the Sabbath School Study Guides freely available any where, anytime, and in as many languages as possible so that everyone can learn more about our Saviour, Jesus Christ.
